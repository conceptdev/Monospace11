The mobile revolution is all about the apps, and expectations of both device capabilities and user experience have profoundly changed. Consumer owned devices are entering the workplace at an unprecedented level, and rather than the IT department dictating device choice the average worker is driving adoption. This seismic shift in the power structure of enterprise IT is creating a huge demand for cross-platform development solutions. CEOâs and CIOâs across industries have made significant investments in C# and .NET technologies. Mono empowers them to bring these technologies to new platforms, and is poised to make a huge impact in the enterprise."

Coroutines, as implemented in MindTouch's DReAM framework or the async method and await constructs coming in C# 5.0, aim to make asynchronous programming simpler by retaining sequential programming workflows, while allowing async suspension of code waiting for completions. This talk will present a brief overview of available asychrony patterns, their pros and cons, and delve into a tutorial on how to use either DReAM coroutines or C# 5.0 asynchronous methods, as well as how the two implementations compare and contrast. Learn how to write code that will take advantage of multi-core architectures and avoid blocking on I/O without having to touch a thread or a lock statement in the process."

    b="For many modern UI applications, managing multiple asynchronous calls whether they be web service calls or calculations in the background, is now a de-facto requirement; however, our tools and frameworks for doing so, Events, are quite primitive and make even simple compositions into complex state management. The Reactive Extensions for .NET greatly simplifies this task, by allowing you to compose event streams in a declarative fashion. On top of Rx, I've built a MVVM framework called ReactiveUI, that allows you to elegantly combine changing Model or ViewModel properties into composite properties to build testable UIs with less effort, even simulating a series of events instantly in a unit test runner using the virtual time scheduler features of Rx."

Traditionally, using a C++ library from C# involved creating a C glue library that served as middleman, proxying all the calls into C++ and back. by creating a flat level of C calls between the two, we lose, among other things, information in terms of object hierarchy, the ability to subclass, and end up with a rather large list of cryptic pinvokes - ugly code, in short."
